/**
	localizer.cpp

	Purpose: implements a 2-dimensional histogram filter
	for a robot living on a colored cyclical grid by 
	correctly implementing the "initialize_beliefs", 
	"sense", and "move" functions.

	This file is incomplete! Your job is to make these
	functions work. Feel free to look at localizer.py 
	for working implementations which are written in python.

           a 2x2 grid, for example, this would be:

    Implements robot sensing by updating beliefs based on the

	@param color - the color the robot has sensed at its location

   		   itself in a 2D world might have the following beliefs:

    	   correct. The ratio of p_hit / p_miss indicates how many
    	   times MORE likely it is to have a correct "sense" than
    	   an incorrect one.

    	   incorrect. The ratio of p_hit / p_miss indicates how many
    	   times MORE likely it is to have a correct "sense" than
    	   an incorrect one.
