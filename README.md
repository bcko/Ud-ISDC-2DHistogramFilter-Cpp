# Ud-IntroSelfDrivingCars-HistogramFilter-Cpp

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to take the python code you wrote when you implemented the two dimensional histogram filter and translate it into C++.

After you review the Python code you will download some starter C++ code. Your job is to complete the functions marked with TODO comments until the histogram filter works as expected!

You can evaluate the correctness of your code by compiling tests.cpp and then running the output. Do this by running the following from the command line.

```
g++ tests.cpp
./a.out
```

## Python Code Reminder
You'll probably want to refer to the 2d Histogram Filter code as you write the C++ version. You can find your Python code here. Make sure you have that link open in another tab before you continue.

## Python to C++
1. First, click here to download the C++ starter code.
2. Open the code in your favorite editor. You'll probably want to have the corresponding Python code around to consult as well.
3. Fill out the functions in localizer.cpp and helpers.cpp

## Project Submission
When your code passes all tests you are ready to compress! Create a zip file of your project by right clicking on the folder that contains all your code and clicking "compress" (or something similar). You will upload the resulting zip file for review!

Once you've submitted you should continue with the Nanodegree. When your code has been reviewed you will be notified and you can review the feedback on your code that the project reviewer left you.
